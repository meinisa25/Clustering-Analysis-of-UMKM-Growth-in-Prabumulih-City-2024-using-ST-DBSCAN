## üì± **About the Project**

This project applies **ST-DBSCAN (Spatial-Temporal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** to analyze the **growth patterns of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM)** in **Prabumulih City, Indonesia (2024)**.  
The study explores how spatial-temporal clustering can provide insights into urban economic development and trade distribution.  

- **Key Finding**: Significant UMKM growth in **Prabumulih Utara** and **Prabumulih Timur** districts.  
- Peripheral regions such as **Camboi, Lembak, and Prabumulih Selatan**, initially classified as *noise*, show emerging business potential.  
- Results support **policy-making and resource allocation** for balanced city development.

## üìã Dataset

The dataset used in this study represents **UMKM point data in Prabumulih City** collected during **April‚ÄìMay 2024**.  
- Data was obtained using **Google Maps**, by retrieving the **latitude and longitude** of UMKM locations.  
- The dataset was then processed and analyzed with the **ST-DBSCAN algorithm** supported by **GIS tools**.  
- The process included:  
  - Selecting appropriate parameters for the algorithm.  
  - Applying the clustering model to the dataset.  
  - Interpreting the results to identify clustering patterns and dynamics of UMKM growth (whether increasing or decreasing) over time.

## üîé Methodology

The clustering process followed 4 main stages:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Collected and cleaned UMKM records (location & temporal data).  

2. **Parameter Selection**  
   - Determined **Œµ (epsilon), MinPts, and temporal threshold** for ST-DBSCAN.  

3. **Clustering with ST-DBSCAN**  
   - Identified high-density regions and separated noise points.  

4. **Cluster Evaluation**  
   - Visualized clusters using maps & density plots.  
   - Interpreted results for regional economic development insights.

## üìä Results

- **Cluster Insights**:  
  - Prabumulih Utara & Timur: high-density UMKM clusters.  
  - Camboi, Lembak, Selatan: emerging clusters from noise points.  

- **Impact**:  
  - Provides **spatial-economic evidence** for UMKM development strategies.  
  - Supports **local government planning** for infrastructure & trade growth.  

‚úÖ ST-DBSCAN proved effective in revealing both **established and emerging business hubs**.
